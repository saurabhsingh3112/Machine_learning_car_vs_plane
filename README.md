# Machine Learning Project: Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This is a machine learning project that demonstrates image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project uses the Keras library with a TensorFlow backend to build and train a CNN model capable of classifying images into two categories - aeroplane and car.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can classify images of aeroplanes and cars accurately. We'll use a dataset of aeroplane and car images for training and testing the model. The images will be preprocessed and fed into the CNN architecture, which will learn to distinguish between the two classes.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two classes: aeroplane and car. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, located in the following directories:
- Training data: r'your training dataset path'
- Testing data: r'your testing dataset path'

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries and tools installed:
- Python (3.6 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Keras
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

## Instructions
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have all the required libraries installed. You can use `pip` to install missing packages.
3. Open `image_classification_cnn.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE that supports Jupyter Notebooks.
4. Execute the notebook cells step by step to build the CNN model, load the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
5. After training the model, you can use your own images to test the model's predictions. Replace the sample images in `D:\my_data\` with your images and follow the instructions in the notebook to load and predict using the model.

## Model Summary
The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and optimized using the RMSprop optimizer.

## Training and Evaluation
The model is trained for 5 epochs on the training data and evaluated on the testing data. The accuracy metric is used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Prediction
After training, the model is capable of making predictions on new images. You can replace the sample images in `D:\my_data\` with your own images and use the provided code in the notebook to load, preprocess, and predict the class labels.

## Note
- The provided code assumes that the directory paths and filenames are correct and the dataset is structured as described. Please adjust the paths if your directory structure is different.
- If you encounter any issues or errors, make sure to check your environment setup and library versions.
